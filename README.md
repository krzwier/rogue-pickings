# rogue-pickings
This is a sample one-page website for an imaginary food truck business. Course project in the [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/) program. 

First iteration was a static page coded to match a design comp in .psd format and designed for desktop. 

Later modifications moved to a mobile-first responsive design, hand-coded using flexbox and breakpoints.
